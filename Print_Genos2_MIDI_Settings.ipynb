        "# Print Genos2 MIDI Settings\n",
        "*by Michael Trigoboff*  \n",
        "(*version 1.0.0*)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "The Genos2 allows you to have user-edited MIDI \"templates\", each of which specifies MIDI settings for the Genos2. You can view and edit these settings on the Genos touchscreen.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be useful to make sure you don't have templates that are essentially duplicates of each other. The template viewer is split up into a lot of separate pages, and this can make it extremely difficult to compare two of these MIDI templates and tell how different they may or may not be.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "It occurred to me that I could write code to read in a **.mis** file, and print it out as a text file. This would facilitate looking at all of the settings for each template at once, which would make it much easier to compare templates with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "This would also allow use of a diff utility like [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/), which can display two text files side-by-side and hilite the differences between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "I packaged this app as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter), a very user-friendly way to combine code with the instructions for its use. (This is an example of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), an idea invented quite a few decades ago by Stanford computer science professor [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth).)\n",
        "\n",
        "Below you will see rectangular areas containing code. These are called **code cells**. You can execute the code in a code cell by clicking on the circular symbol that will appear within the square brackets at the top left of the cell when you hover your mouse between them\n",
        "\n",
        "(*See image, which hopefully appears below. I have noticed that occasionally images included in this Jupyter notebook may not appear. If that happens to you, I hope the text descriptions will be explicit enough to enable your successful use of this notebook.*)\n",

        "The first code cell is labeled \"set up the software\". Execute that code cell now. You will only need to execute it once. Once you have done that, scroll down to the next code cell.\n"
